# Welcome to my Jupyter Book

This is a small Jupyter Book project for me to practice building a Jupyter Book.
It shows off a few of the major file types, as well as some sample content.

To learn more about Jupyter Book, check out [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for more information.

Check out the content pages bundled with this sample book to see more.
