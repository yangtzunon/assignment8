>The Clay Mathematics Institute (http://www.claymath.org/millennium/) of Cambridge, Massachusetts (CMI) has named seven "Millennium Prize Problems," selected by focusing on important classic questions in mathematics that have resisted solution over the years. A 7 million prize fund has been established for the solution to these problems, with 1 million allocated to each. The problems consist of the Riemann hypothesis, Poincaré conjecture, Hodge conjecture, Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, formulation of Yang-Mills theory, and determination of whether NP-problems are actually P-problems.'

>In 1900, David Hilbert proposed a list of 23 outstanding problems in mathematics (Hilbert's problems), a number of which have now been solved, but some of which remain open. In 1912, Landau proposed four simply stated problems, now known as Landau's problems, which continue to defy attack even today. One hundred years after Hilbert, Smale (2000) proposed a list of 18 outstanding problems.

In this note book, we will take a look at two interesting ones

## Happy Ending Problem

![Happy Ending Problem](images/points.png)

The happy ending problem is so named because it led to the marriage of two mathematicians who worked on it, George Szekeres and Esther Klein. Essentially, the problem works like this:



Make five dots at random places on a piece of paper. Assuming the dots aren't deliberately arranged—say, in a line—you should always be able to connect four of them to create a convex quadrilateral, which is a shape with four sides where all of the corners are less than 180 degrees. The gist of this theorem is that you'll always be able to create a convex quadrilateral with five random dots, regardless of where those dots are positioned.



So that's how it works for four sides. But for a pentagon, a five-sided shape, it turns out you need nine dots. For a hexagon, it's 17 dots. But beyond that, we don't know. It's a mystery how many dots is required to create a heptagon or any larger shapes. More importantly, there should be a formula to tell us how many dots are required for any shape. 

Mathematicians suspect the equation is 

$M=1+2N-2$

where M is the number of dots and N is the number of sides in the shape. But as yet, they've only been able to prove that the answer is at least as big as the answer you get that way.

## Inscribed Square Problem

![Inscribed Square Problem](images/square.png)


Draw a closed loop. The loop doesn't have to be a circle, it can be any shape you want, but the beginning and the end have to meet and the loop can't cross itself. It should be possible to draw a square inside the loop so that all four corners of the square are touching the loop. According to the inscribed square hypothesis, every closed loop (specifically every plane simple closed curve) should have an inscribed square, a square where all four corners lie somewhere on the loop.


A more exact statement of the question requires a couple of (fairly simple) definitions.

A simple closed curve is the image in the plane $R^2$ of a continuous function f: [0,1] ----> R2 that is one-to-one except that 

$f(0) = f(1)$


This has already been solved for a number of other shapes, such as triangles and rectangles. But squares are tricky, and so far a formal proof has eluded mathematicians.
